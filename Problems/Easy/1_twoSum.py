"""
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1]

Explanation:

We are looking for two numbers such that they add up to a specific target. Therefore, every number has only 1
other pair that, when added to it, will equal the targetted value. Knowing this, we can just use a dictionary.
The key will be the value that matches the pair with the index of the index that matches it.
